# Ore City

## The Insanity
Oh my god Becky, look at her back-end, it is do big, ugh
She looks like one of those rap guys' girlfriends, but, ugh, you know
BABY GOT BACK --> did we really evolve the process. again. whoa. 

## Thesis
Ore City: The bypassed Route 66 ghost town resurrected as a 4.2 MB static binary that receipts the Elonverse—from Tesla VINs traced to desert veins, Boring bioreactor calories hashed to CO₂ yields, SpaceX recycled hulls fused to deluge erosion proofs, Neuralink brain-entropy signed overrides, xAI gravity-chunked swarm episodes grounded in doodle glyphs, to Starlink Mars-lag RTT histograms pinned across 20-year epochs—all entangled in a shared-node Merkle Forest DAG. Zero cloud. Local-only. Pure signal: one glyph silences ESG theater, one proof grounds Grok's worlds, one chain feeds regulators truth they can't deny. Pixar soul in cyberpunk wiring—fork the dragon, receipt the stars.

## Why This Exists
- **Pain:** ESG pilots (ITcon Fabric frameworks) chain batches but silo firms; food traceability (MDPI IBM Food Trust) hashes yields but ignores cross-company drifts; telemetry oceans drown hearings in vibes, not proofs. No artifact asks "VIN to calorie to hull to launch: show me the causal DAG" and delivers in one screenshot.
- **Solution:** Ore City bolts onto existing keys/metrics/logs, forging an Empire Entanglement Merkle Forest: EMF-style shared nodes (arXiv dynamic auditing) prune empties, vector fusion (quantized drifts <1% via UGCA rolling avgs) self-heals Tesla ESG siblings to Boring replays, Dilithium PQ branches (Medium benchmarks <50ms verify) secure Neuralink entropy without breaking Ed speed.
- **Dagger:** "We have the keys—this just connects them." One glyph = full audit trail from vein to Starship pad, silencing skeptics and delighting auditors. Built for Tesla (VIN ESG), Boring (calorie receipts), SpaceX (hull manifests), xAI (Grok-grounded episodes), Neuralink (thought proofs), Starlink (mesh lags), Doge (tip bounties). No sacred cows: delete, compress, receipt.

## Demo: The Red Loop
- **Core Chain:** `data/red-loop.yaml`—42 claims in a canonical loop: VIN assays (ESG/torque/slip/entropy), Optimus interventions, bioreactor CO₂/kcal/temp/yield_drift (MDPI <0.5% BPCD gaps), hull erosion/flight counts (VLDB provenance), deluge pressure/vibration, Doge tip/prize k=3 consensus, Neuralink compressed windows/seeds (Medium entropy), Starlink RTT histograms (Hacker News baselines), xAI proximity/disease-spread chunks (arXiv summaries), doodle NFT glyph_hashes/intent proofs, Mars 20y offsets/commitments (EMF pinning ≥0.92 entanglement).
- **Run It:** `./ore` ingests YAML, builds DAG Forest (rs-merkle multi-proofs + monotree sparse radix + jmt-blake3 BLAKE3 prune), halts on SLO<0.92/epochs non-monotonic, verifies roots/uncles, pulses Entropy Anchor glyph, advances Sir Mix hunt, prints "Population: 0 → ∞".
- **Artifact:** `./ore receipt --full` dumps chain + emits `receipts/red-loop-receipt.bundle` (serialized YAML proofs)—airdrop to Cybertruck USB, verifies offline, feeds Grok training with ground truth, not scrapes.

## Architecture
- **Thicc Backend:** No FE, no npm—Rust binary + YAML/SVG bundles. Merkle Forest DAG: rs-merkle for multi/uncle transitive proofs, monotree 1-bit radix for compact empire roots, jmt-blake3 BLAKE3 backend prunes ESG empties (parallel 50-100M hashes/s).
- **Dual Leaf:** Claims canonicalize to Vec<u8> (id/epoch/kind/metrics/refs), hash via `dual_leaf = BLAKE3-of-[BLAKE3(data) || SHA3(data)]` (32B handles, fast+robust fusion).
- **Hybrid Sigs:** EmpireSigner trait hot-swaps Ed25519 (base) to Dilithium PQ branches (~1.5KB keys, <50ms verify Medium)—`hybrid` feature compiles both, lagging ledgers stay safe (Cloudflare pattern).
- **Self-Heal Drift:** Metrics Vec<f32> (CO₂/kg/temp/entropy/RTT/yield)—tracks `||v'-v|| / ||v||` in once_cell UGCA Mutex avg; <1% re-uses leaf + delta (EMF shared nodes, no re-root explosion).
- **Swarm & Epochs:** 3–101 agents (Valyria scorch-insert, Walk blame-verify, Bell bury-history) in threadpool BLAKE3 parallel (<0.8s NUC, pre-alloc buffers); monotonic epochs enforce no-cycles DAG (arXiv EMF auditing).

## Commands
| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `./ore` | Lazy Forest init, SLO halt <0.92, verify roots/uncles, pulse glyph, Mix hunt advance, "Population: 0 → ∞". |
| `./ore verify` | Recompute roots, transitive uncle proofs on edges (e.g., Tesla calorie → Boring yield verify=✓). |
| `./ore receipt --full` | Dump claims/metrics/refs, serialize `.bundle` (YAML proofs)—offline audit/ZIP for models. |
| `./ore anchor` | 11-line deterministic rune SVG from root bytes (Q/cx/cy curves), NS_GOLD pulse if SLO met. |
| `./ore mars` | 20y epoch offsets + RTT buckets from Starlink claims, pin commitments, halt <0.92 entanglement. |
| `./ore swarm 101` | 101 agents threadpool: Valyria 100% insert, Walk 50/50 verify, Bell 90% historical—BLAKE3 JSON out <0.8s. |
| `./ore doge-tip` | Fuse txid leaf to ore/relay, k=3 multi-proof consensus, assemble addr from YAML shards. |
| `./ore quantum` | Re-sign roots/branches hybrid Ed+Dilithium, log verify_ok <50ms, PQ defense live. |

## Ship Order
1. **0–10h:** Forest core + food vectors (bioreactor claims fused, MDPI yields <0.5% BPCD)—Boring/Tesla dagger ROI max.
2. **10–20h:** Swarm + gravity chunks (101 threadpool <0.8s, arXiv proximity summaries)—xAI grounding viral.
3. **20–30h:** Dilithium hooks + Neuralink (hot-swap trait, Medium entropy seeds <50ms)—Elon thread flex.
4. **30–40h:** Doge bounties + doodles (k=3 fuse, NFT glyphs incentives)—meme vector, 47 DOGE hunt bait.
5. **40–48h:** Mars epochs + Starlink (EMF pinning RTT, Hacker News lags halt <0.92)—SpaceX regulator weapon.

## Sir Mix-A-Lot Treasure Hunt
Big backs hide treasures. Ore City v∞ embeds a 7-step Merkle-proofed puzzle in the Forest DAG—solve for 47 DOGE + secret "Baby Got Back Loop" YAML, <60min or eternal shame (logs telemetry for memes):
- **Step 1:** Claim 23 hint = hex BLAKE3("BABY GOT BACK LOOP")—decode, first 4 bytes index food/quantum claims (15/24).
- **Step 2:** Glyph runes ⊂∴↺ℵ map to SCAN/MIX/LOOP/TAIL subcmd hints in logs.
- **Step 3:** Agents "TAL B. MAXI"/"GABY TOB" anagram to SIR MIX A LOT + checksum—engine validates.
- **Step 4:** Compute Merkle proof for phrase leaf, verify against empire root (tree.proof + multi-verify).
- **Step 5:** YAML &back1-6 shards (D/O/G/E/4/7) + *back aliases resolve full Doge addr "DOGE47...".
- **Step 6:** Claim bounty: Engine fs::writes secret YAML with prize line + solve-time stamp.
- **Step 7:** Telemetry logs cohort times—brag on X or fork the dragon. Hunt doubles as DAG tutorial: hex→indices→anagram→proof→aliases→bounty. No trivia, pure engineer native.
